1. You can declare many variables in one statement.
Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

2. A declaration can span multiple lines:
 person = "John Doe"
carName = "Volvo"
price = 200

3. Display the following output :- 
var x = 10;
{
var x = 2;
document.write(x);
}
document.write(x);

4. State true or false
var x = 2;   
let x = 3;   
{
let x = 2;   
let x = 3;   
}

{
let x = 2;   
var x = 3;   
}

5. Value of x is 

const x = 10;

{
const x = 2;
document.write(x);

}
document.write(x);

6. Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:

var x = 2;    
const x = 2;   

{
let x = 2;    
const x = 2;   
}

{
const x = 2;   
const x = 2;   
}

7.Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed: 

const x = 2;     
x = 2;           
var x = 2;       
let x = 2;       
const x = 2;     

{
  const x = 2;  
  x = 2;        
  var x = 2;    
  let x = 2;     
  const x = 2;   
}

8. Declare Using let Multiply 7 by 8 and display the result using document.write.

9. Declare Using let Subtract 15 from 25 and display the result.using document.write.

10. Using Ternary Operator Check if 10 is greater than 5 and display the result using document.write.

11. Compare if the string "5" is equal in value and type to the number 5 using ===, and display the result.using ternary operator

12. Concatenate the strings "Hello" and "World" with a space in between, then display the result.using document.write.

13. Question: Display the type of the variable x , y , z  where x = 42

13. Add the number 10 to the string "Days" and display the result.

14. Check if an array is an instance of the Array class and display the result.

15. Use the ternary operator to check if the number 10 is even or odd and display "Even" or "Odd".

16. Declare a string and a number, then display their types using typeof.

17. Declare a boolean, a number, and a string, and display their values in one line using concatenation.

18. Create an object employee with properties name, age, and position, and display the name and position.

19. Declare a variable count with an initial value of 5. Increment it by 1, then decrement it by 2, and display the final value. 

20. Check if the number 8 is greater than 5 and less than 10 using logical AND (&&), and display the result.

21. Perform a bitwise OR operation on the numbers 5 and 3, then display the result.

22. Use the bitwise NOT operator on the number 4 and display the result.
