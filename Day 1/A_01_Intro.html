            //Variable :- It is a container which holds some type of value.
            //Default scope variable ;
            //Depriated we will not used these thing.
            //  a = 9 ;
            //  a = "Gutam";
            // console.log(a);

            //in js we declared variable in some scopes
            //In JS three ways to decalred any variable :- let var const
            //Var scope specific variable;
            //re-declaration is allowed ;
            //re-assignment is allowed 
            //Note :- Depricated in ECMAScript
            //  var a = 9 ;
            // var a = "Nikum";
            // console.log(a);

            //Let scope specific Variable
            //let is a variable which is block specific .
            //re-decalartion is not allowed
            //re-assignment is allowed.
            // let x = 10;
            //  x = "Gautam";
            //  console.log(x);

            
            //Notes :-Rules for declaring variable
            //1. letter , digit , underscore & $ sign used to declared variable.
            //2.must begin with a $ , _ or a letter.
            //3.js reserved words we cannot used .
            //4.arun aand ARUN both meaning are different(Case -sensitive)


            //diff btw var and let

            //Const scope specific Variable
            //re-dealartion and re-assignment are not allowed.
            const asd = 10;
            asd = 112;
            console.log(asd);


            //  document.write("var value a= "+a);//if i want to run on browser
            //  console.log(a)//if i want to run on console 

            //Some Important Points :- 

            //Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

            // It separates HTML and code
            // It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
            // Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
