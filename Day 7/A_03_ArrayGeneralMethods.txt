1.Array Searching and Indexing
Given the array let num = [15, 25, 35, 25, 45, 25, 55];, find the index of the first occurrence of 25 and the last occurrence of 25. What will be the output if you search for 100 in the array?

2. Array Slicing
Given the array let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35];, use the slice method to create a new array containing elements from index 2 to 4. What happens to the original array?

3. Cloning an Array
Write a JavaScript function cloneArray that clones an array. Test it using cloneArray([1, 2, 3, 4]) and cloneArray([5, [6, 7], 8]).

4. Array Concatenation
Combine the arrays let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];, let moreFruits = ["cherry", "date"];, and let evenMoreFruits = ["elderberry", "fig"]; using the concat method. What will be the result?

5. Sorting an Array Alphabetically
Sort the array let words = ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "date"]; in alphabetical order using the sort method. What happens when you sort numbers like [5, 2, 10, 1] without a compare function?

6. Sorting an Array Numerically
Using the array let numbers = [100, 5, 50, 10];, sort it in ascending order using a compare function.

7. Reversing an Array
Reverse the array let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]; using the reverse method. What will be the output?

8. Deleting an Array Element
Given the array let items = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];, delete the element at index 2. What happens to the array length and the deleted index?
