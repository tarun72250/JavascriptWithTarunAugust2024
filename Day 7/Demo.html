    //Questions :- Write a js program to generate a random number and store it in a variable . 
    //The program then takes an input from the user to tell them weather the guess was correct , greater or lesser than the original number.
    //100-(no of guesses) is the score of the user . The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed.
    //Number should be between 1-100.
