1. create an array of numbers and take input from user to add numbers to these array.
2. Keep adding numbers to the array in 
3. filter for numbers divisible by 10 from a given array.
4. create an array of square of given numbers.
5. use reduce to calculate factorial of a given number from an array of first n natural numbers (n being the number whose factorial need to be calculated).



1.Finding an Index:
Given an array let colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"];, write code to find the index of the element "green". What is the index, and what happens if you search for an element that doesnâ€™t exist in the array?

2.Last Occurrence:
Given an array let numbers = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44, 130];, find the last occurrence of the number 130. What index is returned?
Slicing Arrays

3.Extracting a Portion:
Given an array let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "mango"];, write code to extract a subarray containing "banana", "orange", and "grape". Print both the original and the new arrays.

4.Cloning an Array:
Write a function that takes an array as input and returns a clone (a shallow copy) of the array using the slice() method.

5.Concatenating Arrays
Merging Arrays:
Given two arrays let firstArray = ["a", "b", "c"]; and let secondArray = [1, 2, 3];, write code to merge these arrays into one. Print the resulting array.

6.Multiple Concatenations:
Write code to concatenate three arrays: let arr1 = [10, 20];, let arr2 = [30, 40];, and let arr3 = [50, 60];. What is the resulting array?

7.Sorting Arrays
Alphabetical Sort:
Given an array let words = ["apple", "Banana", "cherry", "date"];, write code to sort these words in alphabetical order. What is the sorted array?

8.Numerical Sort (Ascending and Descending):
Given an array let numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];, write code to sort this array in ascending and descending order. Print the array after each sort.
Reversing Arrays

9.Reverse an Array:
Given an array let letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];, write code to reverse the array. Print both the original and the reversed arrays.

10.Deleting Array Elements
Deleting an Element:
Given an array let animals = ["cat", "dog", "elephant", "giraffe"];, write code to delete the element "dog" using the delete keyword. What happens to the array after deletion?

General Array Methods
11.Combining Methods:
Given an array let data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];, write code to reverse the array, then sort it in ascending order, and finally slice the first three elements to create a new array. Print all the steps and the final 
array.

12.Searching with Slice:
Write code that uses the slice() method to find a subarray in a larger array and then uses the indexOf() method to find an element within that subarray. Given let array = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];, find the index of 20 within the slice [15, 20, 25].

13.Using forEach:
Question: Given an array of numbers, write a function that uses forEach to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
Challenge: Modify the function to also find the product of all elements in the array.

14. Using map:
Question: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array where each element is squared.
Challenge: Modify the function to return a new array where each element is squared only if it is even.

15. Using filter:
Question: Write a function that filters out all the odd numbers from an array.
Challenge: Modify the function to filter out all numbers greater than a certain value provided as a parameter.

16. Using reduce:
Question: Write a function that uses reduce to find the maximum number in an array.
Challenge: Modify the function to find both the maximum and minimum numbers in the array using a single reduce call.

17. Using every:
Question: Write a function that checks if all elements in an array are positive numbers.
Challenge: Modify the function to check if all elements are multiples of a given number.

18. Using some:
Question: Write a function that checks if there is at least one negative number in an array.
Challenge: Modify the function to check if there is at least one number divisible by a given number.

19. Combining Methods:
Question: Given an array of numbers, write a function that first filters out all numbers less than 10, then squares the remaining numbers, and finally returns the sum of these squared numbers.
Challenge: Modify the function to return the product of these squared numbers instead of the sum.

20. Array Manipulation:
Question: Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with all elements multiplied by 5. Use map for this.
Challenge: Modify the function to first filter out any elements less than 10 before multiplying by 5.
