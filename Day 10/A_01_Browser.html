    <h1>Hello from DebugShala</h1>


    <script>
        //Javascript in the browser.

        // Javascript was initially created to make web pages alive .
        // Js can be written right in a web page's HTML to make it interactive.

        // The browser has an embedded engine called the Javascript engine or the Javascript's runtime.

        // Javascript's ability in the browser is very limited to protect the user's safety .


        //Note :- Script tag specificity :-

        // Advantages of Script tag :- 
        // 1. Separation of concerns
        // 2. Browser Caching

        // Browser caching is a technique used by web browsers to store copies of web resources (like HTML pages, CSS files, JavaScript files, images, etc.) on a user's local device. When a user visits a website, their browser downloads these resources and stores them in a cache (a special storage area).

        // The next time the user visits the same website, the browser can load the cached versions of these resources instead of downloading them again from the web server. This process speeds up page load times, reduces server load, and saves bandwidth.

        // How Browser Caching Works
        // Initial Request: The first time a user visits a website, the browser sends a request to the server, which responds with the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.). These files are then stored in the browser's cache.

        // Subsequent Requests: On subsequent visits to the same website, the browser checks if the cached versions of the resources are still valid (based on caching rules provided by the server). If they are valid, the browser uses the cached files instead of downloading them again.

        // Cache Expiration: Caches can expire based on headers set by the server, such as Cache-Control and Expires. These headers tell the browser how long a file should be kept in the cache before checking with the server for a newer version.

        // Conditional Requests: If the cache has expired, the browser sends a conditional request to the server, asking if the cached version is still up to date. If it is, the server responds with a 304 Not Modified status, and the browser continues using the cached version.

        // Benefits of Browser Caching :- 
        // The benefit of a separate javascript file is that the browser will download it and store in its cache.
        // Improved Performance: Loading resources from the cache is much faster than downloading them from a server, which improves the overall user experience.
        // Reduced Server Load: Since fewer requests are sent to the server, the server can handle more users simultaneously.
        // Bandwidth Savings: Cached resources reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded, saving bandwidth for both the user and the server.
